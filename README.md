# Modernizr-Detectizr

*Modernizr JS + Detectizr JS concatenated libraries*

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/modernizr-detectizr.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/modernizr-detectizr)

> Because I was sick of building Modernizr each time I needed it and because I always concatenate both libraries to use them together. So... I just made a repo with them.
