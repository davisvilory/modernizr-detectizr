# Modernizr-Detectizr

*Modernizr JS + Detectizr JS concatenated libraries*

> Because I was sick of building Modernizr each time I needed it and because I always concatenate both libraries to use them together. So... I just made a repo with them.

**[Detectizr](http://barisaydinoglu.github.io/Detectizr/)**: v2.2.0 from [CDN](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/detectizr)
